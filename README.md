# Nexa Wallet

**Nexa Wallet** is an **Account Abstraction (AA)** smart wallet built to make crypto management simple, secure, and intuitive.
It combines an **AI Agent**, **real-time token prices from Pyth Network**, and a clean modern interface for sending, receiving, and swapping assets.

## Key Features

### 1. Account Abstraction Smart Wallet
* Smart-contract–based wallet creation and management.
* Send and receive **ETH** and **ERC-20 tokens** easily.
* Built with **AA transactions**, removing the need to handle private keys directly.

### 2. AI Agent (uAgent via ASI:One)
* Integrated AI assistant available on every page.
* Helps users navigate the wallet, explains actions, and answers questions in chat.
* Example dialogue:
  > User: ”How can I send tokens?” 
  > AI Agent: ”Just click ‘Send’, choose a token, and confirm your transaction. I’ll handle the rest!” 

### 3. Real-Time Token Prices (Pyth Network)

* Integrated with **Pyth Network** to display accurate market prices for each token.
* Users can see their total portfolio value in **USD** and **ETH**, updated live.

### 4. Token Management & Swaps

* Supports **ETH ↔ WETH swaps** directly within the wallet.
* Separate views for **Send**, **Receive**, and **Token Details**.
* Fast, intuitive, and minimal UI designed for everyday use.
* 
### 5. Settings

* Includes a **Log Out** button that clears local storage and redirects to the homepage.
* Future updates will add theme switching, wallet import/recovery, and security controls.
